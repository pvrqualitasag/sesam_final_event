## Outline

* Goals
* Data
* Normalisation
* Supervised Statistical Learning
* Second Level Algorithm
* Alerting System
* Procedure and Data Logistics
* Conclusions


## Goals

1. Second Level Algorithm (SLA): Establish relations between behavior of a cow and traits of economic importance using supervised statistical learning
2. Alerting System (AS): Use results from SLA to develop an alerting system


## Data

* Records with 
    + cow ID
    + time span
    + basic behavior
* Basic behaviors consist of
    + eating
    + laying
    + ruminating
    + standing
    + walking
    
    
## Data Aggregation

* Meaningful aggregation level

$\rightarrow$ Amount of time for each behavior per day

* Common pattern of behavior for cows for each day (?)
* Resulting plots also used in Alibaba


## Example Plot

`TODO: Include plot here`


## Normalisation

* Sources of variation not related to traits of economic importance
    + differences in behavior of individual cows
    + differences between farms
* Behavior must be corrected for these source of variation
* Remaining variation can be associated to events of interest for second level algorithm and alerting system

$\rightarrow$ result after correction are normalised data


## Supervised Statistical Learning

Two steps

1. Training of a model with estimation of model parameter
2. Trained model is used to predict future outcomes
